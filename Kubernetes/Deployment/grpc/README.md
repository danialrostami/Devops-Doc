# gRPC in Kubernetes - Deployment Guide

## **What is gRPC?**
gRPC is a **high-performance RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework** developed by Google. It uses:
- **Protocol Buffers (protobuf)** as interface definition language (IDL)
- **HTTP/2** for transport (enables multiplexing, streaming)
- **Strong typing** with code generation in 11+ languages

## **Key Features & Benefits**
| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Binary protocol (protobuf) | 3-10x smaller payloads vs JSON |
| HTTP/2 multiplexing | Concurrent calls over single TCP connection(50% less latency vs REST) |
| Bidirectional streaming | Real-time client/server communication |
| Native load balancing | Works seamlessly with Kubernetes services |
| Generated client code | Reduces manual API glue code |
|Connection Reuse       | 60% fewer TCP connections    |

## **Why gRPC in Kubernetes?**
1. **Efficient Microservices Communication**
   - Ideal for **service-to-service** calls in polyglot environments
   - Lower latency than REST (especially for internal East-West traffic)
   - Health Checking with K8s liveness/readiness probes
